# state-pattern-unity
A clean and extensible implementation of the State design pattern in Unity using C#. This repository demonstrates how to organize game logic (e.g. player states, AI behavior, or UI flows) into modular, testable, and maintainable state classes. Includes examples and templates to help integrate the pattern into your own Unity projects.
